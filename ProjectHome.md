A phpBB3 mod for tracking of players availability for raid nights.

See the [Introduction](Introduction.md) for a more in depth description of the project and it's progress.

[Release Notes](PhpBB3Backlog.md) can be found on the Backlog page

This site will host the source-code of both MOD (phpBB3) and Addon (WoW), but the Addon will be released through Curse http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/raidattendancy

Though... in-game addon for wow, is so far non-existing, the phpBB3 mod is working and being used by guilds (The Awakening, Bloodhoof).
