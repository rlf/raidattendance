= Introduction =

This addon is spawned from a need stated by a guild officer in [http://www.the-awakening-guild.com The Awakening] on the Bloodhoof realm.

He basically needed a way to track player attendance at raid nights - esp. whether they had signed off or not.

Metanoias original post:
 First up story time.....

 In the days of yore I used to track player attendance on a spreadsheet.
 You only had to be online to get credit for being available.
 A row for each raider and a column for each raid night
 I would colour the boxes green for available - yellow for known afr - red for being  missing without warning
 From this it gave a great overview and anyone taking liberties was easily brought to account


 ok story time over
 As you can gather what I'd be looking for is an addon that could do the job of my old  spreadsheet in game.
 If interested enjoy if not I think I might take a stab at this one myself as thinking  about how I'd do it was fun
