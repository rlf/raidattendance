== How do I sign off from a raid? ==
Simply click the signoff icon (X) of the future raid you wish to signoff from.

== How come I can't sign off? ==
_When I login as 'Cool Forum User' I cannot sign off as 'Cool Raider', how come?_

Because the MOD doesn't know you well enough to map 'Cool Forum User' to 'Cool Raider'.

An admin of the forum may be able to help you out there - otherwise change your forum-username to your raider-name.

== How come I can't signoff from a raid in the past? ==
Because it's in the past... You should've signed off before hand... SLACKER!

== How the freaking f**king god do you come up with those numbers?? ==
Well, the numbers are taken from 3 months back and up till the date currently displayed.
Static sign-offs (e.g. all Mondays for some) is merged into the calculation, starting from the first non-static-status (i.e. first time raider either attended a raid, was AWOL etc.).

The Attendancy percentage displayed in the tooltip is NOT how many of the raids the raider attended, but rather how often the raider have been available. I.e. sums of Green and Cyan cells.
