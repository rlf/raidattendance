== How do I sign off from a raid? ==
Simply click the signoff icon (X) of the future raid you wish to signoff from.

== How come I can't sign off? ==
_When I login as 'Cool Forum User' I cannot sign off as 'Cool Raider', how come?_

Because the MOD doesn't know you well enough to map 'Cool Forum User' to 'Cool Raider'.

An admin of the forum may be able to help you out there - otherwise change your forum-username to your raider-name.

== How come I can't signoff from a raid in the past? ==
Because it's in the past... You should've signed off before hand... SLACKER!
