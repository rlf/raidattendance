== Administrators ==
=== Where do I find the raidattendance MOD on the ACP?===
_I've logged in as administrator in the ACP, but can't find the freaking Raid attendance, where is it?_

It is located under the FORUMS tab (per default the second tab):

=== How do I add raiders to the raider-list?===
As an administrator you can add raiders from the armory using the _Resync with armory_ button on the _Raiders_ pane, or manually add raiders using the very last row on the list and the _Save_ button.

== Forum Users ==
=== How do I sign off from a raid? ===
Simply click the signoff icon (gray question mark) of the future raid you wish to signoff from.

=== How come I can't signoff from a raid in the past? ===
Because it's in the past... You should've signed off before hand... SLACKER!

=== How come I can't sign off? ===
_When I login as 'CoolForumUser' I cannot sign off as 'CoolRaider', how come?_
Because the MOD doesn't know you well enough to map 'CoolForumUser' to 'CoolRaider'.

An admin of the forum may be able to help you out there - otherwise change your forum-username to your raider-name.
