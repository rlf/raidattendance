#summary Page for the phpBB3 mod to go along with the Lua Addon

= Introduction =

This page will keep the design decisions and howto's related to the development of the phpBB3 mod.

= Architecture =
The mod will be divided into 3 parts as described below.

*ACP* (Admin Control Panel) will be the part used to configure and install the mod - it will only be available to the phpBB3 administrators.

*MCP* (Moderator Control Panel) will be available to moderators of the forum in which the raidattendance resides - here the moderators can change the raid-setup and in time sync with wowarmory.

*MOD* will be a page integrated into one of the forums (e.g. "Raid Attendancy") which will always be shown as a table on top/bottom of the forum - displaying the current raider signon/signoff/noshow status.
