#summary Page for the phpBB3 mod to go along with the Lua Addon
#sidebar ToC

= Introduction =

This page will keep the design decisions and howto's related to the development of the phpBB3 mod.

= Design =
This design is (for now) centered around the user-experience we are aiming at - i.e. there will be no mentioning about how to configure/install/setup the MOD.

= Architecture =
The mod will be divided into 3 parts as described below.

*ACP* (Admin Control Panel) will be the part used to configure and install the mod - it will only be available to the phpBB3 administrators.

*MCP* (Moderator Control Panel) will be available to moderators of the forum in which the raidattendance resides - here the moderators can change the raid-setup and in time sync with wowarmory.

*MOD* will be a page integrated into one of the forums (e.g. "Raid Attendancy") which will always be shown as a table on top/bottom of the forum - displaying the current raider signon/signoff/noshow status.

  * ACP - Admin Control Panel
    * Settings for the raidattendance mod
    * Install wizard for database
    * Sync. feature with wowarmory (code reuse of MCP below)
