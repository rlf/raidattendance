= Libs and dependencies =

This addon will rely on the Ace-3 lib.

= Details =

== Settings ==

  * Raid days (mon - sun) - which days do we raid (when should ppl be available)
  * Raid time (19:45) - exact time
  * Raider Guild Rank (0-?) - Which players should be accountable?
  * Tryout Guild Rank (0-?) - Which players should be tracked as well?

== Main Layout ==

= Development Plan =

This is the "product back log" for those who know about the Scrum way.

== Product Back Log ==

The user/player should
  * ... get a table of all raiders as rows, and attended raids as columns
  * ... update the table manually to reflect the current raid-attendance of "now" (create a new column)
  * ... change state of raiders who are not online to "signed off".
  * ... see a column of "raid-attendance" as a percentage of recorded raid-nights.
  * ... cancel a raid-night (delete a column, or just mark it?)
  * ... be able to configure raid-days and raiding-time in addon-settings
  * the addon must be able to do the "scan" automatically at the raid-time
