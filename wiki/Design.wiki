This project is divided into 3 smaller projects:
  # The Addon - This will be a WoW Lua Addon (Bulrogg)
  # A Client - This will access the folder of the addon and sync. the addon database with a web-based-database.
  # A phpBB3 MOD - This will show the data from the database, and allow users to sign off.



= Development Plan =

This is the "product back log" for those who know about the Scrum way.

== Product Back Log ==

=== Addon ===
The user/player should
  * ... get a table of all raiders as rows, and attended raids as columns
  * ... update the table manually to reflect the current raid-attendance of "now" (create a new column)
  * ... change state of raiders who are not online to "signed off".
  * ... see a column of "raid-attendance" as a percentage of recorded raid-nights.
  * ... cancel a raid-night (delete a column, or just mark it?)
  * ... be able to configure raid-days and raiding-time in addon-settings
  * the addon must be able to do the "scan" automatically at the raid-time

=== Client ===
  * Will most likely not be neccesary, if we manage to integrate the addon and the php-mod correctly, it will become a simple upload/download task
