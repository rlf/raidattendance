=== Backlog ===
The user/player should
  * Import raid from phpBB MOD.
    * Date, raid-time, raiders, roles, classes, status.
    * Some security hash - raider-name + content
  * Update status based on current online-status.
    * If before or at raid-invite-time mark online raiders as ON.
    * If after raid-invite-time mark offline raiders as LATE.
    * If after raid-time mark offline raiders as AWOL.
  * Setup raid-time
    * Automatically fire "update" at raid-invite-time + raid-time.
  * Edit raider-status
    * Enable the user to toggle between all statusses.
    * If the user has manually set a status, the auto-update should NOT overrule it.
  * Export raid to phpBB MOD
    * Some security hash - login-name + content.

=== Client ===
  * Will most likely not be neccesary, if we manage to integrate the addon and the php-mod correctly, it will become a simple upload/download task
