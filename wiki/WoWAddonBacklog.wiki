=== Backlog ===
The user/player should
  * ... get a table of all raiders as rows, and attended raids as columns
  * ... update the table manually to reflect the current raid-attendance of "now" (create a new column)
  * ... change state of raiders who are not online to "signed off".
  * ... see a column of "raid-attendance" as a percentage of recorded raid-nights.
  * ... cancel a raid-night (delete a column, or just mark it?)
  * ... be able to configure raid-days and raiding-time in addon-settings
  * the addon must be able to do the "scan" automatically at the raid-time

=== Client ===
  * Will most likely not be neccesary, if we manage to integrate the addon and the php-mod correctly, it will become a simple upload/download task
