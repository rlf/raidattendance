# Introduction #

This addon is spawned from a need stated by a guild officer in [The Awakening](http://www.the-awakening-guild.com) on the Bloodhoof realm.

He basically needed a way to track player attendance at raid nights - esp. whether they had signed off or not.

The project then consists of different smaller sub-projects:
  * PhpBB3Mod - A MOD to the phpBB3 forum, which allows users to signon/signoff for raid nights.
  * WoWAddon - An Addon for WoW - which integrates with the PhpBB3Mod to show who has signed off, and sync. who was actually online in game.
